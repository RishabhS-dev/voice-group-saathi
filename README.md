Welcome to ChaatAI, a voice-driven AI platform designed to empower India’s illiterate and semi-literate street food vendors by enabling them to pool raw material orders and access wholesale prices — using just their voice.

🧐 Problem We Are Solving
In India, 30% of street food vendors are illiterate or semi-literate, and they struggle with:

Paying higher prices for raw materials due to low individual buying power.

Inability to negotiate bulk discounts like restaurants.

Difficulty in using complex apps (most solutions are text-heavy).

Lack of a trusted, simple system to collaborate with nearby vendors.

🎯 Our Solution — ChaatAI
ChaatAI is a Voice-First Group Buying Platform that allows vendors to:

Speak their raw material needs (in Hindi or regional dialects).

Automatically join group orders with nearby vendors.

Negotiate bulk discounts collectively with suppliers.

All this — without typing, reading, or downloading complex apps.

🚀 How It Works — User Flow
Vendor visits the web app on their phone (no app download needed).

They press the mic button and record a voice note: “5kg aloo chahiye, koi saath milega?”

AI transcribes & matches the order with other vendors in the same locality.

Vendors see a Group Order Card (e.g., “4/10 joined. Save ₹7/kg if you join.”)

When threshold is met, ChaatAI auto-generates a bulk SMS to trusted suppliers.

Vendors receive confirmation of their discounted bulk purchase.

🧑‍🍳 Who is This For?
Street Food Vendors (Thela-walas, small stalls)

Semi-literate or illiterate vendors who find apps intimidating.

Vendors in urban and semi-urban India who suffer due to lack of bulk buying power.
